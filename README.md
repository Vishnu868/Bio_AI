Project Overview ==>
This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs). Understanding these interactions is critical for various applications, including drug discovery, understanding disease mechanisms, and cancer research. However, experimentally identifying PPIs is costly, time-consuming, and often limited in scale, resulting in incomplete interaction networks. The goal is to use available biological data, such as amino acid sequences and structural information, to create a computational model that accurately predicts potential PPIs.

Problem Statement ==>
The main challenge addressed in this project is predicting PPIs using computational models due to the complex structure of proteins and the difficulty in understanding the binding sites between protein molecules.

Objectives ==>
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Compile a comprehensive and diverse set of biological data, including known PPI datasets and other relevant features.
Model Evaluation and Validation: Rigorously evaluate the performance of the developed models using cross-validation and relevant performance metrics.

Applications ==>
Drug Discovery and Development
Understanding Disease Mechanisms
Cancer Research
Evolutionary Biology

Conclusion ==>
This project aims to develop an advanced machine learning application that accurately predicts potential PPIs, offering solutions with significant implications for drug discovery, disease understanding, and basic biological research.
